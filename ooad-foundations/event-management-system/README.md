# Traditional OOAD Event Management System

This demo implements an event management system using classic Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) principles, adhering to Gang of Four patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer) and SOLID best practices. It serves as a baseline for comparison with the Value-Driven Domain Pattern demo.
